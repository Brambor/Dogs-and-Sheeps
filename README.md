# Introduction
Dogs-and-Sheeps is a little simulation created to learn classes in python. I will improve it over time.

# Features
### Living organisms

 - Dogs hunting Sheep, killing them and eating their Corpses.
 - Sheep searching for Grass and eating.
 - Sheep reproducing with other Sheep.
 - Grass that grows.

### Settings

 - Easy way to change map dimensions, FPS, number of Dogs, Sheep, Grass.

### Graphics

 - Plain old Graphic (not badass old film look...)
 - Pure text (without some features)

# Lots of Ideas
Rocks (these are on the way!), better searching for a target (speed of it), dying of old age OR fight, zombie sheep (not sure), tourists, Bacas, ghosts, water - lots and lots changes related to it, better value changing system, and more!

# Short and small preview
Bare in mind that Sheep are smarter now.
