# Dogs-and-Sheeps
This is a little simulation created to learn class in python. I will improve it over time.

Features:Dogs hounting Sheep, killing them and eating their Corpses. Sheep searching for Grass and eating it then reproduce with other Sheep. Grass that grows.
Easy way to change map dimensions, FPS, number of Dogs, Sheep, Grass.
Graphic (not badass old film look...)

Ideas: rocks (these are on the way!), better searching for target (speed of it), dying of old age OR fight, zombie sheeps (not sure), tourists, Bacas, ghosts, water - lots and lots changes related to it, better changing values system, and more!

Short and small preview (now Sheep are smarter:
